This is a circuit that allows switching a load using an imput from a microcontroler
The reasons I used this specific MosFET is because it works with a logic level imput (5V)
on the gate, and I already had it.
It is intended to be used for frequency switching (eg: controlling a 12V LED Lamp)
I didn`t send this to manufacturing since it is easier to recreate it on PerfBoard
DISCLAIMER: This project has NO warranty that will work the way It`s supposed to work
